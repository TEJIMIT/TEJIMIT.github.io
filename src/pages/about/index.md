**Providing students with non-traditional learning and social justice opportunities while preparing incarcerated students for successful reentry through education and technology.**

The Educational Justice Institute @ MIT brings together two worlds, the world of MIT, undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff, and the world of incarcerated populations and staff in Massachusetts correctional facilities.  Overseeing the program are two Co-directors whose experience spans both worlds.  Carole Cafferty is a 30 year veteran of Massachusetts corrections, a former superintendent of a Massachusetts Correctional facility, and an adjunct professor in criminal justice at UMass/Lowell.  Lee Perlman has taught philosophy and political philosophy at MIT, Harvard, Swarthmore and Brown for 34 years, and has been taking classes into Massachusetts prisons since the 1980â€™s, and teaching credit bearing university courses in prison for 6 years.

The program includes an ever expanding group of initiatives:

Primary
* Classes bring together the philosophical, the political, and the practical (aka coding & writing)
* Philosophy in prison as a way of making the inner life of inmates richer, allowing for self-reform
* An organization seeking to do its part to attenuate mass incarceration, stratification of opportunity (among a variety of social conditions)
* Aiming to improve outcomes as crucial as recidivism, employment for inmates post-release, and conduct while in prison.
* Goal: sound like the program engenders social justice without being a social justice program?
* An unique opportunity for MIT students to learn about parts of the human experience that are not commonly available to them, and to give back, offering their skills to make Massachusetts safer and more educated.
