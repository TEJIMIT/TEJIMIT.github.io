              The Educational Justice Institute (TEJI) is an innovative and groundbreaking initiative that provides a transformative learning experience for incarcerated individuals and university students.  Founded in 2017, TEJI is growing exponentially by developing co-learning opportunities for students both behind and outside of prison walls.
            </p>

            <p>
              TEJI aims to enhance the prospects for incarcerated individuals by empowering them to reach their potential and re-define their identity through higher education and the use of technology to prepare for reentry.  The social-emotional benefits of education, such as an increased sense of self-worth and self-motivation, coupled with job readiness preparation, are immeasurable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through working and studying with justice-involved individuals under the auspices of TEJI, MIT students experience the issues and challenges facing men and women who are incarcerated in prisons and jails. They gain firsthand knowledge regarding the complexities surrounding Americaâ€™s incarcerated population, have the potential to develop a sustained commitment to community involvement, and develop increased empathy and compassion, as they directly experience the humanization of those who have been de-humanized by our society. As future leaders in the United States and across the world, these experiences provide useful and necessary development opportunities that will enhance their future work.
            </p>

            <p>
              TEJI has accomplished much in its short existence, including:
