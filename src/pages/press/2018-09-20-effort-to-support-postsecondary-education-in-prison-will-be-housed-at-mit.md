The MIT Educational Justice Institute will lead a consortium to support expanding access to postsecondary education to people currently and formerly in prison statewide, fueled by a grant by the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Other member schools include Boston University, Emerson College, Mt. Wachusett Community College, and Tufts University.

The effort will draw upon the expertise of MITâ€™s Lee Perlman, a lecturer in philosophy who has taught prior classes to cohorts consisting of MIT students and incarcerated students, and Carole Caffery, a program administrator with over 25 years of experience as a corrections professional.
