The Augmented Reality Mural Project is first of its kind and will provide a unique opportunity for incarcerated women at the South Bay House of Correction to begin the healing process through art expression. The incarcerated students and the MIT students are creating a powerful mural together and learning from one another throughout the course. The incarcerated women are exposed to STEM education through learning the basics of augmented reality design which will overlay the mural. The incarcerated students involved in this project have overcome tremendous challenges throughout their lives and have endured unthinkable trauma. This project provides not only a vehicle for expression and healing, yet also arms the women with tools necessary for success through improved self-confidence.
