TEJI has taken the lead with supporting and managing efforts to increase postsecondary education and career / technical training with incarcerated people in Massachusetts. The consortium began with a handful or schools and to date there are over (20) schools ranging from Harvard and Wellesley to community colleges, all working together to achieve our collective goal.

Massachusetts Prison Education Consortium (MPEC), to be administered by The Educational Justice Institute at MIT (TEJI@MIT). The purpose of the MPEC is to enhance educational resources available to incarcerated students and to provide them with greater continuity of education and support. This will be achieved in a number of ways, such as coordinating resources across the various partners to efficiently offer a wide array of classes, providing students with ample support, and facilitating the continuation of education upon re-entry through a cohesive educational pipeline.
