With approximately 2.3 million individuals behind walls, correctional facilities has, unfortunately, become a characteristic part of American society.  Nevertheless, due to security concerns and ethical questions surrounding the use of incarcerated individuals for research, academics face difficulty in studying the direct and indirect influences of this unique institution on human behaviors on the individual and the family, friends, and community at large.  

Leveraging professional connections, knowledge of rules and regulation around correctional facilities, TEJI facilitates inter-disciplinary research surrounding correctional facilities by working with scholars from broad range of academic domains such as sociologists, economists, psychologists, etc.  Working with Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab of MIT (J-PAL), which has over a decade of history in researching poverty and impact of innovative economic programs, we explore correctional facilities as a new frontier in poverty research in the US.

As a first step in this endeavor, we are building partnerships with correctional technology leaders such as specialized educational tablet providers used in correctional facilities.  Working with these technology leaders, we aim to understand how technologies such as educational tablets can be used to shape incentives and behavioral norms that can guide human behavior in this unexplored, unique environment.
