With approximately 2.3 million people behind walls, the correctional facility has, unfortunately, become a typical feature of the American landscape. Despite its prevalence, academics face difficulty conducting research on  the influences of this unique institution on those incarcerated, as well as their family, friends, and community at large, due to security concerns and ethical questions.

The Educational Justice Institute (TEJI), newly founded at MIT, provides a promising opportunity to study the effects of incarceration on American society. Leveraging decades of experience teaching the incarcerated, valuable professional connections, hands on corrections management experience, and expert knowledge of the rules and regulation around correctional facilities, TEJI has the ability to facilitate interdisciplinary research in and around this institution. We welcome scholars across the academic spectrum to work with us on issues surrounding the incarcerated.

Current initiatives include partnering with The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) to explore correctional facilities as a new frontier in poverty research in the US. We are also building partnerships with correctional technology leaders that provide specialized educational tablets used in correctional facilities.  Working with these technology leaders, we aim to understand how such technologies can be used to shape incentives and behavioral norms that can guide peopleâ€™s behaviors.

We welcome inquiries regarding potential research collaborations. Please contact Lee Perlman or Carole Cafferty at <a href="mailto:teji@mit.edu">teji@mit.edu</a>.
