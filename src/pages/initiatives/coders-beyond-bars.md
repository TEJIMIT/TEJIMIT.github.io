In the United States today, employment opportunities are abundant for those who possess high-tech skills, as the use of information technology expands in various industries.  The American economy faces a shortage of 180,000 people with data analytical skills, such as software engineering and data science. Due to its concentration of high-tech companies, this shortage is particularly acute in Boston and offers an employment opportunity for area residents who have the requisite information technology skills.

A willing population exists that could fill these openings, had they the training and access to these jobs. Incarcerated individuals face formidable employment challenges upon release, due to their conviction records, limited opportunity to acquire vocational skills, and lack of marketable skills. Studies suggest that over 60% of formerly incarcerated individuals return to prison within three years of being released. Lack of viable employment opportunities is a major factor contributing to this high rate of recidivism.

The Educational Justice Institute (TEJI) at MIT is exploring a variety of ways to alleviate the many challenges faced by incarcerated individuals upon reentry. Through its Coders Beyond Bars (CBB) initiative, it offers them the chance to take an introductory course in computer programming. By learning the fundamentals of coding and database management, students gain the skills needed to secure entry-level positions in a variety of fields, such as biotechnology, finance, and software engineering.

In addition to offering programming courses, CBB pairs students with mentors in technology companies. Paid internships provide on-the-job training, putting the skills learned in class to practical use.  We anticipate that these opportunities will result in full-time employment for many of the participants, a win for both the students and corporations alike.
