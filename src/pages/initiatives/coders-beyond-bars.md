Today, employment opportunities are growing for those who possess high-tech skills such as software engineering and data science as the use of information technology expands in various industries.  American economy faces a shortage of 180,000 talents with data analytical skills, and this shortage is particularly acute in Boston due to concentration of high-tech industries.  Meantime, blue-collar jobs are disappearing due to overseas outsourcing and automation.  This trend is particularly problematic for incarcerated individuals who will face formidable employment challenges due their conviction records and the lack of skills applicable in jobs that are less susceptible to automation and outsourcing.  Studies suggests that over 60% of formerly incarcerated individuals return to prisons within three years of being released and that lack of employment opportunities is a major contributing factor to the high rate of recidivism.

Due to stigma against criminal record and lack of opportunities to acquire various vocational skills, many incarcerated individuals face severe limitation in their career choices after their release.  In order to alleviate the numerous challenges faced by incarcerated individuals after reentry into society,  we at The Educational Justice Institute at MIT (TEJI@MIT), through its Coders Beyond Bar initiative, propose Introduction to Computer Programming.  The primary aim of this program, which spans approximately eight months, is to equip incarcerated students with introductory, but essential, skills such as computer programming and database management so that the students can be on a path toward securing entry-level positions in the high-tech tech industries such as biotechnology, finance, and software engineering.

In addition to courses in computer programming, our program aims to connect our students with technology companies in Boston in various industries such as biotechnology, finance & banking, software engineering, etc. that can offer paid-internship opportunities to our students upon successful completion of our program.  Internships will provide additional on-the-job training for the students and may develop into full-time employment opportunities in the partnering companies.
